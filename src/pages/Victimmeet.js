                                            My path as a web and software developer has revolved around one thing:
                                            staying passionate about what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve been taking development as a career since 2014.
                                            These days I spend my time pursuing my passion of developing for clients and sharing
                                            with others all that I‚Äôve learned. I started offering workshops at some pretty
                                            incredible locations around the world and I cannot wait to see where we end up next!

                                            I grew up in Zimbabwe and still live here today. I graduated high school back in 2013 and made it for
                                            four years into university before securing my first job at Sandvik Mining and Construction Company.
                                            Later l changed my job to join FBC Holdings Bank: a bank which l had worked with during my internship
                                            back in 2016. I realized it was going to benefit me a lot to work in the banking industry,
                                            I said ‚Äúlet me get on with it‚Äù and until now l am still working at FBC Holdings Bank,
                                            It‚Äôs a decision I haven‚Äôt regretted for a single second.<br/>
                                            I consider myself a rather bad Zimbabwean. Don‚Äôt get me wrong,
                                            I get somewhat annoyed when people talk about how Zimbabwe is the most beautiful place on Earth.
                                            It‚Äôs not (please don‚Äôt send me hate mail for that, fellow Zimbabweans).
                                            The things that keeps me here are my family (both sides of the family are here),
                                            the freedoms we have here that other countries simply do not, the morality,
                                            and occasionally the weather (mainly storm season).

                                            but I lucked out in a few areas and I do my best not to take that for granted. I have an absolutely incredible and
                                            beautiful girlfriend, mum, dad and my four siblings. They are the love of my life and I seriously cannot believe they
                                            put up with me on a daily basis :-). I anticipate to work from home as a web and software developer.
                                            I‚Äôm so happy to be able to work a bit close to my family though it takes a lot of work and dedication
                                            to make this possible. I am also fortunate
                                            to have most of my other family living close as well and l spend a lot of time with them and love them all dearly.

                                            I know this seems obvious, but it really is my main passion. Software has always helped me to see clearer,
                                            to save life and capture the beauty that is all around us in the management of complexity and
                                            creation of solutions (that we so often overlook).

                                            I love to read, whether with a traditional book or listening to books through Audible.
                                            I enjoy mostly nonfiction, choosing books that will teach me something I didn‚Äôt know before
                                            or something I want to learn more about. The bible is the top one in my favourite books list!

                                            I will never understand people that don‚Äôt travel. I don‚Äôt think less of them or anything like that,
                                            I just don‚Äôt understand it. The world (as Discovery Channel would say) is just awesome.

                                            <p>
                                                I don‚Äôt want to spend the best years of my
                                                life working 40-80 hours a week so that I can relax and enjoy life when I‚Äôm on hospice.
                                                Tomorrow is never guaranteed so there‚Äôs no time like right now to get out there and experience the world.
                                                This will prove to be a very lengthy conversation piece should you ever sit down with me for coffee,
                                                dinner or a drink.
